1. Data Collection & Loading
Use Python (pandas.read_csv) or SQL to load and explore the dataset.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use Python/Excel to:

Check class distribution (default vs. non-default).

Visualize distributions of income, loan amount, age, etc.

Analyze correlations between features and default status.

3. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (impute or remove).

Encode categorical variables (LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder).

Remove outliers if necessary (boxplots, z-scores).

4. Feature Engineering
Create new features (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-income).

Use domain knowledge to build meaningful metrics.

Scale data if using logistic regression or distance-based models.

5. Modeling
Try multiple models in Python:

Logistic Regression (good for interpretability)

Random Forest / XGBoost (better performance, handles non-linearity)

Evaluate using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

AUC-ROC Curve

6. Model Interpretation
Feature importance from Random Forest/XGBoost

Coefficients from Logistic Regression

7. SQL Integration (Optional but Impressive)
Upload cleaned data to a SQL database

Write SQL queries to generate insights:

What income range defaults the most?

What is the default rate by state or loan grade?

8. Excel Dashboard (Optional Bonus)
Export summary tables to Excel.

Create a simple interactive dashboard (Pivot Charts, Slicers) to show:

Default rate by loan type

Income vs. risk buckets

üìÅ Deliverables
Python notebook with analysis, modeling, and results.

A few sample SQL queries + screenshots.

Optional Excel dashboard.

Final PDF or blog-style report summarizing findings and recommendations.
